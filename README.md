Tvarita
=======

Tvarita is a very hasty wiki. It was built as a small test to see how much work the most basic functionality of a wiki (the online editting of pages) would be to implement with Flask.

Setup
-----

Set up a [virtualenv](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv) if you wish (the author advises the use of virtualenv).

Using [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip), install the following dependencies (this can be done automatically with `pip install -r requirements.text`):

    Flask (0.9)
    Jinja2 (2.6)
    Markdown (2.3.1)
    Werkzeug (0.8.3)
    argparse (1.2.1)
    wsgiref (0.1.2)

Now you're ready to go, just start `run.py`.


Disclaimer

This wiki is very hastily built, and is most likely not secure. Do not use this for production!

You're free to do with this software what you want. But if you are somehow going to make money with it, I would love to hear how you did it out of curiosity.
